# CAST: Candidate Alert System for Transients

**CAST** is a Django-based Target and Observation Manager (TOM) system designed to manage and follow up on astronomical transient candidates. It builds on the [TOM Toolkit](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base) and adds custom functionality such as real/bogus scoring, Transient Name Server (TNS) integration, and transient tracking utilities.

       'candidates',
   ]
2. **Run database migrations**:
   ```python
   python manage.py makemigrations candidates
   python manage.py migrate

### 3. Update settings.py Configuration
